## 🧭 Overview

**CoreInventory** is a full-stack, modular Inventory Management System (IMS) built to digitize and streamline stock-related operations through a centralized, real-time web application.

It handles the complete lifecycle of stock: receiving goods from vendors, moving stock between locations, delivering to customers, and reconciling physical counts — with every validated movement written to an immutable audit ledger.

---

## 🔥 Problem Statement

Businesses typically manage inventory through disconnected tools — spreadsheets, paper registers, or siloed apps — which leads to:

| Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|
| Inaccurate stock levels | Overstocking or stockouts |
| Delayed inter-team updates | Fulfillment errors |
| Missing audit trails | Compliance risks |
| Slow replenishment decisions | Revenue loss |

CoreInventory addresses each of these through clearly defined operational workflows and a unified data model.

---

## 👥 Target Users

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Inventory Manager** | Configure products, warehouses & locations; validate receipts & deliveries; oversee all operations |
| **Warehouse Staff** | Execute transfers, adjustments, shelving & picking; perform day-to-day stock handling |

---

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 1. Authentication & Access Control
- Secure signup and login
- OTP-based password reset via email
- JWT access + refresh token authentication
- Role-based authorization (`manager` / `staff`)

### 2. Dashboard
Real-time operational snapshot with KPIs:
- Total products in stock
- Low-stock and out-of-stock alerts
- Pending receipts, deliveries, and scheduled transfers

**Filter by:** document type · status · warehouse · location · product category

### 3. Product Management
- Create and edit products with SKU, category, unit of measure, and optional initial stock
- Category management
- Configurable reorder rules per product/location
- Stock visibility per product and location

### 4. Receipts *(Incoming Stock)*
Stock arrival workflow:
```
Create Receipt → Add Lines → Validate → Stock +qty | Move Record Written
```
> Example: Receive 50 units of Steel Rods → stock **+50**

### 5. Delivery Orders *(Outgoing Stock)*
Stock dispatch workflow:
```
Create Delivery → Add Lines → Validate → Stock −qty | Move Record Written
```
> Example: Ship 10 Chairs → stock **−10**

### 6. Internal Transfers
Move stock between any combination of locations or warehouses while preserving total on-hand quantity.
> Examples: `Main Warehouse → Production Floor` · `Rack A → Rack B` · `Warehouse 1 → Warehouse 2`

### 7. Stock Adjustments
Reconcile physical counts against system quantities:
```
Select Product/Location → Enter Counted Qty → Validate → Delta Applied | Reason Logged
```

### 8. Move History (Ledger)
Every validated inventory movement is permanently recorded — fully traceable and audit-ready.

---

## 🏗️ Inventory Flow Example

```
1. Receive goods           → +100 kg Steel (stock increases)
2. Internal transfer       → Main Store → Production Rack (total unchanged)
3. Deliver to customer     → −20 kg Steel (stock decreases)
4. Adjust damaged stock    → −3 kg Steel (adjustment logged with reason)
```

All four events are captured in the stock ledger with timestamps, actors, and quantities.
